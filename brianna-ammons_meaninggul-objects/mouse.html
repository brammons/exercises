    <h1>Logitech MX Vertical</h1>
    <p>This is the ergonomic mouse I use for all of my <strong>coding</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong> when I am at home. It means a lot to me because it's one of the items I have that lets me create some of my best work. Being able to make art is extremely important to me and this has helped me do a lot of that.</p>

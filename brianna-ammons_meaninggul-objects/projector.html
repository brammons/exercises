    <h1>Parents' Old Projector</h1>
    <p>This is the projector I use to watch all of my <strong>movies</strong> and <strong>TV shows</strong> at home. It means a lot to me because I use movies and TV as a way to wind down at the end of a long day. I also have a lot of interest and passion for film so having this projector really connects me to that.</p>

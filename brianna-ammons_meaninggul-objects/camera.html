    <h1>Canon Rebel XTi</h1>
    <p>This is the DSLR camera I use to take a lot of pictures on <strong>special trips</strong> and <strong>headshots</strong> for friends. It's special to me because it's the first camera I got when I started to take photography more seriously. I have a lot of memories of my high school journalism classes and trips with family that are associated with it.</p>
